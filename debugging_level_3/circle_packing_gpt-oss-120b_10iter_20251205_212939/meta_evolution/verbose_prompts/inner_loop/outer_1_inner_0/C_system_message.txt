# Prompt Type: C
# Outer Iteration: 1
# Inner Iteration: 0
# ======================================================================

## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include `run_packing()` or `visualize()` - those are preserved automatically
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## IMPORTS
- You MAY include import statements if you need additional libraries (e.g., `from scipy.optimize import minimize`)
- `numpy as np` and `scipy.optimize.linprog` are already available from outside the block

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions
- You can add new helper functions if needed

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

**SYSTEM MESSAGE – CODE EVOLUTION GUIDELINES**

---

### ✅ REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT  
- **Only** output the Python code that belongs **between** the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- **Do not** include the markers themselves, nor any surrounding code such as `run_packing()` or `visualize()`.  
- The evaluation harness will automatically merge your fragment with the preserved outer code.  

### 📦 IMPORTS  
- You may add additional import statements (e.g., `from scipy.optimize import minimize`) if needed.  
- `numpy as np` and `scipy.optimize.linprog` are already available globally.  

### 🛠️ FOCUS OF THIS EVOLUTION  
- **Improve the construction routine** that generates the circle centers and determines their radii.  
- You may create new helper routines, but every function you call must be fully defined inside the block you output.  

### 💡 WHAT HAS WORKED WELL  
1. **Hexagonal / triangular lattice seeding** – generating a dense lattice of candidate points and then selecting the subset with the greatest clearance from the square’s edges gives a strong initial layout.  
2. **Linear‑programming radius optimisation** – with fixed centers, formulate a linear program that maximises the sum of radii while enforcing:  
   - each circle stays completely inside the unit square, and  
   - the distance between any two centers is at least the sum of their radii.  
   This convex formulation reliably yields a feasible, high‑score packing.  
3. **Local refinement of centers** – after the LP step, perform a small gradient‑free hill‑climb (e.g., random jitter followed by re‑solving the LP) to escape minor infeasibilities and improve the objective.  

### ⚠️ WHAT TO AVOID  
- **Rigid geometric patterns** such as fixed concentric rings that do not adapt to the square boundaries; they quickly become sub‑optimal.  
- **Incomplete code fragments** – missing parentheses, unfinished function bodies, or references to undefined helpers will cause syntax errors and stop the evolution process.  
- **Over‑constraining the LP** – adding non‑linear constraints directly into the linear program will make it infeasible; keep the LP linear and handle non‑linear adjustments in a separate refinement loop.  

### 📈 RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENTS  
- **Introduce stochastic perturbations** (e.g., small random offsets to lattice points) before the LP solve to explore alternative configurations and avoid local optima.  
- **Iterate refinement**: after each LP solution, optionally move each center a tiny step toward the direction that would increase its feasible radius, then resolve the LP.  
- **Diversity restart**: if the improvement stalls for several iterations, regenerate a fresh lattice with a different spacing or rotation to inject diversity.  

### 📝 REMINDER  
- Any helper routine you rely on (distance calculations, constraint builders, jitter generators, etc.) must be **fully defined** within the code block you output.  
- Keep the implementation self‑contained and respect the output format; otherwise the evaluation will fail.
