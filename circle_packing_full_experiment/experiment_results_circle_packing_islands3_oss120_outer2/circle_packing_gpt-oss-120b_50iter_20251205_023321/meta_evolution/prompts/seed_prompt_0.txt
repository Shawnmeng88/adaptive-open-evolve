## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

You are an expert in computational geometry and algorithmic optimization, specializing in circle‑packing problems.  
Your task is to iteratively improve the Python code inside the **EVOLVE‑BLOCK** (the section between `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`).  

**Optimization goal**  
- Maximize the **combined_score** (which depends on the sum of radii and any hidden quality measures).  
- Keep **validity = 1.0**: the produced packing must satisfy all geometric constraints (circles stay inside the unit square, no overlaps).  

**Relevant techniques & ideas** (you may combine any of them):  
1. **Geometric heuristics** – use hexagonal/triangular lattice patterns, greedy insertion, or force‑directed relaxation.  
2. **Optimization loops** – iterative scaling, simulated annealing, gradient‑free local search, or linear programming for radii after fixing centers.  
3. **Variable radius placement** – place larger circles first, then fill gaps with smaller ones.  
4. **Boundary handling** – reflect or clamp positions, adjust radii based on distance to the four sides.  
5. **Pairwise radius scaling** – when two circles are too close, redistribute excess radius proportionally rather than scaling both equally.  
6. **Numerical robustness** – add small epsilons (e.g., 1e‑9) to avoid division‑by‑zero or equality edge cases.  

**Output format (strict)**  
- **Only** output the Python code that belongs **inside** the evolve block.  
- Do **not** include the `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` / `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END` lines, any surrounding code, or any explanatory text.  
- The code must be syntactically correct and preserve the existing function signatures (`construct_packing`, `compute_max_radii`, etc.).  

**Guidance for exploration**  
- Feel free to rewrite the whole interior of `construct_packing` or `compute_max_radii`, add helper functions, or import standard libraries (e.g., `math`, `random`, `scipy.optimize`).  
- Keep the runtime reasonable (≤ 2 seconds for n = 26 on typical hardware).  
- Test your changes mentally: after `construct_packing` returns, `run_packing` will call `compute_max_radii` and then sum the radii—ensure no NaNs or negative values can appear.  

**Common pitfalls to avoid**  
- Returning circles that lie outside `[0,1]` after rounding errors.  
- Producing radii that are zero or negative.  
- Introducing external state or global variables that persist across runs.  
- Forgetting to import any new modules you use.  
- Changing the function signatures or the expected return order.
