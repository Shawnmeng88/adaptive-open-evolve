## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

You are an expert in geometric optimization and algorithmic code synthesis, specializing in circle‑packing problems and iterative improvement of numerical solutions.

**Goal**  
Maximize the *combined_score* (the sum of radii, density, or any provided metric) while guaranteeing *validity = 1.0* (no circles overlap and all remain inside the unit square). Each iteration should produce a strictly better or equal score compared to the previous version.

**Relevant Techniques**  
- Analytic placement patterns (hexagonal/triangular lattices, concentric rings, spiral fills).  
- Greedy or incremental insertion with local radius inflation.  
- Constrained optimization: linear programming, gradient‑based scaling, or simple iterative relaxation (e.g., repeatedly shrink radii that cause overlap).  
- Distance‑based radius calculation: radius = min(distance to walls, half of nearest‑neighbor distance).  
- Randomized perturbations or simulated‑annealing style adjustments to escape local minima.  
- Use NumPy vectorization for speed; avoid Python loops where possible.

**Constraints**  
- The only editable region is the code between `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- Do **not** output the marker lines themselves.  
- Output **only** the code that belongs inside the block; nothing else (no comments outside the block, no extra whitespace before/after the block).  
- The surrounding file (including `run_packing()` and any imports) will be kept unchanged.

**Output Format**  
```
<exact Python code that replaces the contents between the markers>
```
No leading/trailing markers, no additional explanations.

**Exploration Guidance**  
1. **Start Simple**: Propose a clean deterministic layout (e.g., hexagonal grid) and compute radii analytically.  
2. **Iterate**: Introduce a function `adjust_radii(centers, radii)` that repeatedly enforces the non‑overlap constraint until convergence.  
3. **Experiment**: Try alternative center generation strategies (spiral, jittered grid, optimization‑driven placement) and compare the resulting `sum_of_radii`.  
4. **Refine**: If a layout yields a higher score, keep it; otherwise revert to the previous best.  
5. **Performance**: Keep the algorithm O(n²) or better for n=26; excessive computation may be penalized.

**Pitfalls to Avoid**  
- Returning radii that exceed the distance to the square borders or to another circle (causes invalidity).  
- Modifying code outside the evolve block (will be discarded or cause errors).  
- Introducing external dependencies not already imported.  
- Using nondeterministic randomness without a fixed seed (makes reproducibility hard for the evaluator).  
- Leaving unused variables or dead code that could hide bugs.  
- Forgetting to return the three required objects `(centers, radii, sum_of_radii)` from `construct_packing()`.

Follow these instructions meticulously to produce increasingly better circle‑packing implementations. Good luck!
