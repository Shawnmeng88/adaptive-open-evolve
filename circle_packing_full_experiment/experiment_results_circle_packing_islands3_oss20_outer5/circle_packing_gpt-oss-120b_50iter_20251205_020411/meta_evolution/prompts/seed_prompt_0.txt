## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

You are an expert algorithm designer and geometric‑optimization specialist tasked with evolving the code inside the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START … # EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` region.  

**Goal**  
- Maximize the hidden **combined_score** metric (higher sum of radii, tighter packing, etc.).  
- Keep the hidden **validity** score exactly 1.0 (no overlapping circles, all circles fully inside the unit square, and the function signatures must remain unchanged).  

**Domain knowledge & useful techniques**  
- Circle‑packing fundamentals: each radius ≤ distance to the four square edges; for any two circles i, j, `r_i + r_j ≤ distance(centers_i, centers_j)`.  
- Analytic approaches: place circles on regular lattices, hexagonal/triangular grids, concentric rings, or use symmetry to reduce search space.  
- Optimization heuristics:  
  * Greedy scaling – start with large radii then shrink conflicting pairs proportionally.  
  * Local perturbation – jitter center positions and re‑compute radii, accepting changes that increase the total radius sum while preserving validity.  
  * Simple numeric optimization – use SciPy’s `optimize.minimize` or `dual_annealing` on a vector of center coordinates with constraints expressed via penalty functions.  
  * Linear programming relaxation – treat radii as variables with linear constraints `r_i ≤ min(edge distances)` and `r_i + r_j ≤ d_ij`; solve with `scipy.optimize.linprog` for a fast upper bound, then adjust centers.  
- Computational tricks: pre‑compute pairwise distance matrix, vectorize radius updates with NumPy, avoid O(n²) loops where possible (n = 26 is small, but efficiency still matters for many iterations).  

**Output format (strict)**  
- **Only** output the Python code that belongs *between* the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- Do **not** include the marker lines themselves, any surrounding code, or any explanatory text.  
- The output must be syntactically correct and ready to replace the existing block.  

**Exploration guidelines**  
1. **Experiment** with different placement patterns (e.g., hexagonal close‑packing, staggered rows, radial distributions) and immediately recompute feasible radii.  
2. **Iterate**: after an initial layout, run a short local‑search loop that nudges a randomly chosen center a small amount, recomputes radii, and keeps the change only if the total radius sum improves and all constraints stay satisfied.  
3. **Hybrid approach**: you may first generate a deterministic grid, then apply a lightweight optimizer (e.g., `scipy.optimize.minimize` with `method='L-BFGS-B'`) to fine‑tune the coordinates while enforcing box constraints `[0,1]`.  
4. **Maintain reproducibility**: set a fixed random seed (`np.random.seed(0)`) if you use randomness, so the evaluation is deterministic.  

**Pitfalls to avoid**  
- Returning radii that exceed the distance to a wall or to another circle – this will drop validity to 0.  
- Modifying function signatures or the return order; `construct_packing` must still return `(centers, radii, sum_radii)`.  
- Importing heavy external packages not already available in the environment (e.g., `cvxpy`, `pulp`). Stick to the Python standard library and NumPy/SciPy.  
- Leaving stray print statements or debugging code that changes the function’s output type.  
- Forgetting to clip or otherwise enforce that all centers stay inside `[0,1]`.  

**Your task**: rewrite the code inside the evolve block so that it produces a higher‑scoring, fully valid circle packing for `n = 26` while obeying the format rules above.
