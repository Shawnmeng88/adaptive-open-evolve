## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

**System Prompt – Guidance for Evolving `construct_packing()`**

You must output **only** the Python code that belongs **between** the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  

- **Do NOT include the markers themselves** in your response.  
- **Do NOT output any code outside those markers** (e.g., imports, `run_packing()`, visualisation helpers, etc.).  
- The surrounding framework will automatically merge your output with the preserved sections; any deviation will cause evaluation failure.

### Objective
Maximize the **total sum of radii** returned by `construct_packing()` while satisfying:

1. Every circle must lie completely inside the unit square `[0,1] × [0,1]`.
2. No two circles may overlap (distance between centers ≥ sum of radii).

### What **must NOT** be done (learned from past failures)
- **Do not** write code that performs uncontrolled iterative searches without clear termination (e.g., “while True” loops that rely on break conditions that may never fire).  
- **Do not** introduce vague constraints such as “must improve” without concrete mathematical formulation.  
- **Do not** add unnecessary parameters like “step” or “constraint” that are never used.  
- **Do not** produce code that has a high invalidity rate (≥ 40 % of generated programs failing the geometric checks).  
- **Do not** use overly aggressive heuristic tweaks that change the problem definition (e.g., allowing circles to extend outside the unit square).  
- **Do not** include any debugging prints, `input()` calls, or external file I/O.  

### Recommended Concrete Strategies
1. **Hexagonal (triangular) lattice**  
   - Compute the lattice spacing `s` that yields at least 26 points inside the unit square when using a staggered rows pattern.  
   - Use a binary‑search or simple analytical formula to find the largest `s` that satisfies the point‑count requirement while keeping all points at least `s/2` from the borders.  
   - Set each circle’s radius to `r = s/2`. This choice guarantees non‑overlap on a perfect hexagonal grid.

2. **Greedy pruning (if the lattice produces more than 26 points)**  
   - After generating the full lattice, sort points by their distance to the square centre (or any deterministic criterion).  
   - Keep the first 26 points; discard the rest.  
   - Because all points share the same spacing, the radius `r = s/2` remains valid for the retained subset.

3. **Boundary safety**  
   - When generating lattice coordinates, offset every point by `r` from the left/bottom edges and ensure the right/top edges are `≤ 1‑r`.  
   - This guarantees each circle is fully contained.

4. **Return format**  
   - `construct_packing()` must return a tuple `(centers, radii)`, where `centers` is a list of `(x, y)` tuples and `radii` is a list of floats of equal length (26).  

5. **Determinism**  
   - Avoid any random sampling; the solution must be fully deterministic so that repeated runs produce identical outputs.

### Implementation Checklist (inside the evolve block)
- Define a helper `_hex_lattice_spacing(min_points=26)` that computes the maximal spacing `s`.  
- Define a helper `_generate_hex_grid(s)` that returns all lattice points respecting the border margin `s/2`.  
- In `construct_packing()`, call the helpers, prune to exactly 26 points, build the `radii` list (`[s/2] * 26`), and return the tuple.  
- Include comprehensive docstrings explaining the math and the pruning rule.  
- Ensure the code runs with only the standard library and `numpy` (already imported in the outer file).  

Follow these guidelines precisely; any deviation will lead to an invalid submission.
