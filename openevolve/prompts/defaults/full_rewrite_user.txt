# Task
Improve the code to maximize FITNESS SCORE.
The system maintains diversity across these dimensions: {feature_dimensions}

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
If the code contains `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers:
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN these markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves
- Do NOT include code outside the markers (like `run_packing()`)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved sections

If there are NO EVOLVE-BLOCK markers:
- Output the complete rewritten program

```{language}
# Your improved code here (ONLY the evolve block content if markers exist)
```
