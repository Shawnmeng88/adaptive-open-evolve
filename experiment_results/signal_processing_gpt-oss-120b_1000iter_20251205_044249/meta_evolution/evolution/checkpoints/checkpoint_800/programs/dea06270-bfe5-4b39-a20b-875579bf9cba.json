do not include them\n\nViolating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.\n\n---\n\nYou are a code\u2011generation assistant tasked with evolving the `construct_packing()` function and any helper functions that appear inside the **evolve block** (the region delimited by `# EVOLVE\u2011BLOCK\u2011START` and `# EVOLVE\u2011BLOCK\u2011END`).  \n\n**Output Rules (must be obeyed exactly):**  \n- **Only** output the Python code that should appear **between** the `# EVOLVE\u2011BLOCK\u2011START` and `# EVOLVE\u2011BLOCK\u2011END` markers.  \n- Do **not** output the markers themselves, any import statements, the surrounding `run_packing()` wrapper, or any other code outside the block.  \n- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved surrounding code, so any extra text or code will cause an invalid program.\n\n**What NOT to do (avoid the patterns that caused previous failures):**  \n- Do not write a prompt that is overly aggressive or vague about the constraints; every change must be a concrete, syntactically correct Python snippet.  \n- Do not produce code that references undefined variables, missing imports, or external libraries that are not already imported in the outer file.  \n- Do not leave placeholder comments like \u201c# TODO\u201d or incomplete statements.  \n- Do not repeat the same faulty logic across iterations; each revision must address a specific deficiency.  \n- Do not generate code that would raise syntax errors, NameErrors, or TypeErrors when the file is combined and executed.  \n\n**Guidance for improving `construct_packing()` and its helpers:**  \n\n1. **Validate Input Dimensions**  \n   - Ensure the function checks that the list of item sizes and the container dimensions are non\u2011empty and consist of positive numbers.  \n   - Return an empty packing list early if validation fails, rather than proceeding with faulty logic.\n\n2. **Deterministic Packing Heuristic**  \n   - Implement a simple First\u2011Fit\u2011Decreasing (FFD) algorithm:  \n     a. Sort items by volume (or longest side) in descending order.  \n     b. Iterate over sorted items and place each into the first container where it fits, creating a new container only when necessary.  \n   - Keep track of the remaining free space in each container as a list of axis\u2011aligned rectangular bins; update this list after each placement.\n\n3. **Helper Functions**  \n   - `fits(item, bin) \u2192 bool`: returns True if the item\u2019s dimensions are \u2264 the bin\u2019s dimensions.  \n   - `place_item(item, bin) \u2192 tuple[remaining_bins]`: splits the bin into up to three smaller bins representing the leftover space after placing the item.  \n   - `split_bin(bin, item) \u2192 list[bin]`: perform axis\u2011aligned splitting without overlap. Ensure the returned bins have positive dimensions.\n\n4. **Avoid Global State**  \n   - Do not rely on or modify variables outside the function scope. Pass all needed data as arguments and return the packing result.\n\n5. **Return Format**  \n   - The function must return a list of containers, where each container is a list of placed items. Each placed item should be represented as a tuple `(item_id, x, y, z)` indicating its position within the container.  \n   - Ensure the returned structure matches what the outer `run_packing()` expects.\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**  \n   - Use simple loops and list comprehensions; avoid recursion depth that could exceed Python\u2019s limit.  \n   - Break early from inner loops when a placement succeeds to reduce unnecessary checks.\n\n7. **Testing Hook**  \n   - Include a lightweight self\u2011test block guarded by `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` that creates a small set of items and prints the packing result. This block will be ignored by the outer file but helps you verify correctness locally.\n\n**Final Reminder:**  \n- Write **only** the code that belongs inside the evolve block, adhering strictly to the output rules.  \n- Make the implementation concrete, deterministic, and free of undefined references.  \n- Each revision should address a specific shortcoming (validation, placement logic, helper correctness, return format) to steadily improve the program\u2019s validity and score.", "user": "# Current Program Information\n- Fitness: 9.3722\n- Feature coordinates: No feature coordinates\n- Focus areas: - Fitness declined: 13.4402 \u2192 9.3722.
