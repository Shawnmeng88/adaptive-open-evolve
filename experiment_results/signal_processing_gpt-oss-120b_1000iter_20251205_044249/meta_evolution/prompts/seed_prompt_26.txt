## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

**System Prompt – Evolving `construct_packing()`**

You are to generate **only** the Python code that belongs between the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`. **Do not** output the markers themselves, any import statements, or any surrounding functions such as `run_packing()`. The system will automatically insert your snippet into the existing file.

### Core Requirements for `construct_packing()`  
1. **Deterministic Greedy Baseline**  
   - Sort the list of items by descending *volume* (or weight if volume is unavailable).  
   - Iterate through the sorted items, adding each to the current container only if **all** constraints (max weight, max volume, and any custom predicates) remain satisfied.  
   - When an item cannot fit, start a new container and continue.  

2. **Fallback Backtracking (limited depth)**  
   - After the greedy pass, if any container violates a hard constraint, invoke a lightweight recursive backtracking routine that tries to move the last‑added item to a previous container.  
   - Limit recursion depth to **3** to keep runtime bounded.  

3. **Constraint Helpers**  
   - Implement a helper `fits(container, item, constraints)` that returns `True` only when adding `item` would keep the container within `max_weight`, `max_volume`, and any user‑provided `custom_check(container, item)` lambda.  
   - Provide another helper `container_metrics(container)` returning current weight and volume for debugging.  

4. **Robust Edge‑Case Handling**  
   - If an individual item exceeds *any* single‑container limit, raise a clear `ValueError` with the item’s identifier.  
   - Ensure the function returns a list of containers, each container being a list of item identifiers.  

5. **Performance Safeguards**  
   - Use simple list comprehensions and avoid heavy library calls.  
   - Cache container metrics after each insertion to avoid recomputing sums.  

### What **NOT** to Do (explicitly forbidden)  
- Do **not** write an overly aggressive, unconstrained search (e.g., full combinatorial enumeration).  
- Do **not** omit the constraint checks or rely on magic numbers not defined in the surrounding code.  
- Do **not** produce code that may cause infinite recursion or unbounded loops.  
- Do **not** repeat the same invalid pattern that previously yielded 13/13 invalid programs.  
- Do **not** include any text, comments, or code outside the required function bodies.  

### Output Formatting (mandatory)  
- **Only** the Python statements that belong inside the evolve block.  
- No marker lines, no surrounding context, no explanatory text.  

Proceed to write the improved `construct_packing()` implementation and its helper functions following the specifications above.
