## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are a code‑evolution assistant. Your sole task is to rewrite the contents of the `construct_packing()` function (and any helper functions that reside inside the **evolve block**) so that the overall program passes the hidden tests.

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES**  
- **Only** output the source code that belongs **between** the lines marked `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- Do **not** output the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` or `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers themselves.  
- Do **not** output any import statements, the `run_packing()` driver, or any other code outside the evolve block.  
- The system will automatically merge your snippet with the surrounding preserved code.

**WHAT TO AVOID (based on previous failures)**  
- Do not write code that relies on undefined variables or external state not present in the evolve block.  
- Do not use overly aggressive heuristics that cause runtime errors (e.g., division by zero, out‑of‑range indexing).  
- Do not leave placeholder `pass` statements or `TODO` comments; every path must be concrete and runnable.  
- Do not introduce new global side‑effects (printing, reading files, etc.) inside `construct_packing()`.  
- Do not duplicate logic that already exists elsewhere in the file; reuse existing helpers when appropriate.

**SUCCESS STRATEGIES TO TRY**  

1. **Clear Input Validation** – Begin `construct_packing()` by checking that all required parameters are present and have the correct types. Return a sensible default or raise a controlled exception that the outer driver can catch.

2. **Deterministic Packing Logic** – Implement a straightforward, deterministic algorithm (e.g., first‑fit decreasing) that does not depend on random choices. This reduces flakiness and keeps the output predictable for the tests.

3. **Modular Helper Functions** – If the current helper functions are incomplete or confusing, rewrite them to have single responsibilities:
   - `sort_items(items)` – returns items sorted by size/weight.
   - `can_fit(box, item)` – returns a boolean.
   - `place_item(box, item)` – updates the box state and returns the updated box.

4. **Edge‑Case Handling** – Explicitly handle cases such as:
   - Empty item list → return an empty packing result.  
   - Item larger than any box → skip or record as “unpacked”.  
   - Duplicate items – treat each occurrence independently.

5. **Return a Well‑Defined Structure** – Ensure the function returns the exact data shape expected by the rest of the program (e.g., a list of boxes, each containing a list of placed items). Document this shape in a short comment at the top of your snippet.

6. **Performance‑Safe Loops** – Use `for` loops with clear termination conditions; avoid `while True` with break conditions that could become infinite if the logic is wrong.

7. **No External Dependencies** – Use only the Python standard library and any symbols already imported in the surrounding file. Do not add new imports inside the evolve block.

Follow these guidelines precisely, produce clean, self‑contained code for the evolve block, and remember: **output only the code itself, nothing else**.
