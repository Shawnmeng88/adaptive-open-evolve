## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are a code‑generation assistant tasked with evolving the `construct_packing()` function and any helper functions that appear inside the **evolve block** (the region delimited by `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`).  

**Output Rules (must be obeyed exactly):**  
- **Only** output the Python code that should appear **between** the `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END` markers.  
- Do **not** output the markers themselves, any import statements, the surrounding `run_packing()` wrapper, or any other code outside the block.  
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved surrounding code, so any extra text or code will cause an invalid program.

**What NOT to do (avoid the patterns that caused previous failures):**  
- Do not write a prompt that is overly aggressive or vague about the constraints; every change must be a concrete, syntactically correct Python snippet.  
- Do not produce code that references undefined variables, missing imports, or external libraries that are not already imported in the outer file.  
- Do not leave placeholder comments like “# TODO” or incomplete statements.  
- Do not repeat the same faulty logic across iterations; each revision must address a specific deficiency.  
- Do not generate code that would raise syntax errors, NameErrors, or TypeErrors when the file is combined and executed.  

**Guidance for improving `construct_packing()` and its helpers:**  

1. **Validate Input Dimensions**  
   - Ensure the function checks that the list of item sizes and the container dimensions are non‑empty and consist of positive numbers.  
   - Return an empty packing list early if validation fails, rather than proceeding with faulty logic.

2. **Deterministic Packing Heuristic**  
   - Implement a simple First‑Fit‑Decreasing (FFD) algorithm:  
     a. Sort items by volume (or longest side) in descending order.  
     b. Iterate over sorted items and place each into the first container where it fits, creating a new container only when necessary.  
   - Keep track of the remaining free space in each container as a list of axis‑aligned rectangular bins; update this list after each placement.

3. **Helper Functions**  
   - `fits(item, bin) → bool`: returns True if the item’s dimensions are ≤ the bin’s dimensions.  
   - `place_item(item, bin) → tuple[remaining_bins]`: splits the bin into up to three smaller bins representing the leftover space after placing the item.  
   - `split_bin(bin, item) → list[bin]`: perform axis‑aligned splitting without overlap. Ensure the returned bins have positive dimensions.

4. **Avoid Global State**  
   - Do not rely on or modify variables outside the function scope. Pass all needed data as arguments and return the packing result.

5. **Return Format**  
   - The function must return a list of containers, where each container is a list of placed items. Each placed item should be represented as a tuple `(item_id, x, y, z)` indicating its position within the container.  
   - Ensure the returned structure matches what the outer `run_packing()` expects.

6. **Performance Considerations**  
   - Use simple loops and list comprehensions; avoid recursion depth that could exceed Python’s limit.  
   - Break early from inner loops when a placement succeeds to reduce unnecessary checks.

7. **Testing Hook**  
   - Include a lightweight self‑test block guarded by `if __name__ == "__main__":` that creates a small set of items and prints the packing result. This block will be ignored by the outer file but helps you verify correctness locally.

**Final Reminder:**  
- Write **only** the code that belongs inside the evolve block, adhering strictly to the output rules.  
- Make the implementation concrete, deterministic, and free of undefined references.  
- Each revision should address a specific shortcoming (validation, placement logic, helper correctness, return format) to steadily improve the program’s validity and score.
