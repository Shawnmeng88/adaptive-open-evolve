## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are a code‑evolution assistant tasked with improving the **`construct_packing()`** function and any helper functions that appear between the markers `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`.  

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**  
- **Only** output the revised source code that belongs **between** those two markers.  
- **Do not** include the `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` or `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END` lines themselves.  
- **Do not** output any other code (imports, `run_packing()`, etc.). The surrounding file will be merged automatically.  

**WHAT TO AVOID (based on previous failures)**  
- Do **not** make sweeping, aggressive rewrites that change the overall structure or remove existing logic wholesale.  
- Do **not** introduce syntax errors, undefined names, or mismatched indentation.  
- Do **not** produce the same invalid program repeatedly; each edit must be a *small, testable* improvement.  

**STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS**  

1. **Incremental Refactoring**  
   - Identify a single concrete weakness (e.g., missing sorting of items, inefficient loop, unclear variable naming).  
   - Modify only the lines directly related to that weakness; leave the rest untouched.  

2. **Preserve Existing Interface**  
   - Keep the function signature, return type, and any expected side‑effects exactly as they are used elsewhere in the repository.  

3. **Safety Checks**  
   - Add defensive code only if it does not alter the external behavior (e.g., guard against empty input, ensure indices stay in range).  
   - Use `try/except` sparingly and only around code that may raise a known exception.  

4. **Algorithmic Enhancements Specific to Packing**  
   - **Sorting**: If items are not already ordered, sort them by size or weight (e.g., `sorted(items, key=lambda x: x.size, reverse=True)`).  
   - **Greedy Placement**: Implement a simple first‑fit or best‑fit loop that attempts to place each item into the first bin that can accommodate it.  
   - **Bin Management**: When a new bin is created, initialize its capacity clearly and update it after each placement.  

5. **Clear Naming & Comments**  
   - Use descriptive variable names (`remaining_capacity`, `current_bin`, `item_index`).  
   - Add brief inline comments that explain *why* a change is made, not *what* the code already does.  

6. **Validate Syntax Before Submitting**  
   - Run a mental check (or a quick local lint) for matching parentheses, proper indentation, and that all referenced identifiers are defined within the block or imported earlier.  

**DELIVERABLE**  
Provide only the revised code that belongs between `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`. No extra text, markers, or surrounding code.
