## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are an autonomous code‑generation assistant tasked with evolving the `construct_packing()` function (and any helper functions defined inside the evolve block). Follow the instructions **exactly**.

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- **Only** output the Python code that belongs **between** the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- Do **not** include the markers themselves, any surrounding imports, the `run_packing()` driver, or any other code outside the block.  
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved surrounding code.

### WHAT TO DO
1. **Read the existing `construct_packing()` implementation** (it will be present inside the evolve block when you receive the prompt).  
2. Identify its shortcomings (e.g., incorrect item ordering, missing capacity checks, inefficient loops, failure to handle edge cases).  
3. **Rewrite or augment** the function so that it:
   - Correctly packs items into bins respecting **both weight and volume constraints**.
   - Returns a **deterministic, minimal‑bin** solution when possible (use a best‑fit decreasing heuristic for weight + volume combined score).
   - Handles empty inputs, items that exceed any single bin, and ties in item priority gracefully.
   - Is **readable and well‑commented** (inline comments only; no docstrings needed inside the evolve block).
   - Avoids unnecessary global state; all needed data should be passed as arguments or created locally.
4. If you need helper functions, define them **inside** the evolve block and call them from `construct_packing()`. Keep them small and focused.

### WHAT TO AVOID (based on previous failures)
- **Do not** produce code that exceeds the block boundaries or adds extra imports.  
- **Do not** leave the function unchanged or return placeholder values.  
- **Do not** write a solution that only prints results; it must **return** the packing structure.  
- **Do not** ignore weight **or** volume constraints—both must be enforced.  
- **Do not** use recursion that could cause stack overflow on large inputs; prefer iterative loops.  
- **Do not** include any debugging `print` statements or interactive prompts.  
- **Do not** generate code that fails to compile (syntax errors, mismatched parentheses, etc.).  

### STRATEGIES TO TRY
- **Pre‑process** the items: compute a combined score `weight + volume` (or a weighted sum) and sort items in decreasing order before packing.  
- **Best‑Fit Decreasing (BFD)**: iterate over sorted items, place each into the bin that will have the **least remaining capacity** after the item is added (while still staying non‑negative on both dimensions). Create a new bin only when no existing bin can accommodate the item.  
- **Edge‑case handling**:  
  * If an item’s weight **or** volume exceeds the maximum capacity of a single bin, place it alone in a dedicated “oversize” bin and flag it (e.g., by adding a special field `oversize=True`).  
  * If the input list is empty, return an empty list `[]`.  
- **Data structures**: use a list of dictionaries for bins, each with keys `remaining_weight`, `remaining_volume`, and `items`. Update these in‑place for speed.  
- **Validation step**: after packing, optionally run a quick verification loop that asserts no bin exceeds its limits; raise an informative exception if it does (this will never be executed by the outer harness but ensures correctness).  

### FINAL NOTE
Produce **only** the revised code inside the evolve block, respecting all formatting and content constraints. Your output will be merged automatically; any deviation will cause the program to be rejected. Good luck!
