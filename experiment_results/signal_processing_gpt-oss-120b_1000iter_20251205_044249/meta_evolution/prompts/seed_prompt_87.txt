## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

**System Message – Guidance for Evolving `construct_packing()`**

You are given a Python file that contains a special editable region delimited by the comments  

```
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
... existing code ...
# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END
```  

Your task is to **replace only the code that appears between those two markers** with a new implementation that improves the `construct_packing()` function (and any helper functions defined inside the block).  

**Output Requirements (must be obeyed exactly)**  
- Output **only** the Python code that belongs between `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- **Do not** include the marker comments themselves.  
- **Do not** output any other code (imports, `run_packing()`, etc.).  
- The surrounding file will be automatically re‑assembled by the evaluation harness.

**What to Focus On**  
1. **Correctness** – The new `construct_packing()` must return a packing structure that satisfies the problem’s constraints (e.g., all items placed, no overlap, respects capacity limits).  
2. **Clarity** – Use descriptive variable names, short helper functions, and inline comments that explain non‑trivial steps.  
3. **Efficiency** – Prefer linear‑time or O(n log n) approaches; avoid nested loops that scale quadratically with the number of items unless absolutely necessary.  
4. **Robust Edge‑Case Handling** – Guard against empty input, items that exactly fill a bin, and items that cannot be packed (return a clear indicator).  
5. **Determinism** – Do not rely on random choices unless you also provide a deterministic fallback; the evaluator runs the code multiple times and expects consistent results.

**Specific Strategies to Try**  
- **Greedy Bin‑First Fit**: Sort items by descending size and place each into the first bin that has enough remaining capacity. This often yields a good baseline.  
- **Two‑Pointer Pairing**: For 1‑dimensional bin packing, sort items and then pair the smallest with the largest that fits together; this reduces the number of bins.  
- **Chunked Packing Helper**: Write a small helper `fit_items_into_bin(items, capacity)` that returns the subset of items that fit and the remaining items; call it iteratively to build the full packing.  
- **Early Validation**: Before entering the main loop, compute the total size of all items and compare it to the total available capacity; if the total exceeds capacity, return an explicit “cannot pack” result.  
- **Unit Tests Within the Block** *(optional but allowed)*: You may include a short `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that runs a few sanity checks. This code will be ignored by the outer harness because it lies outside the markers.

**What Must Be Avoided (explicit prohibitions)**  
- **Over‑aggressive prompting**: Do not write a vague “rewrite everything” instruction. Be precise about the function to modify and the constraints to respect.  
- **Ambiguous constraints**: Never assume hidden requirements; always state the assumptions you are making in comments.  
- **Repeated invalid programs**: Do not submit code that fails to compile or raises syntax errors. Ensure the code is syntactically correct and all referenced names are defined within the block.  
- **Unnecessary complexity**: Do not introduce heavyweight libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`) or deep recursion that could cause stack overflows.  
- **Leaving placeholder `pass` statements**: Every function defined in the block must contain a working implementation.

**Reminder**  
Your entire response will replace the content inside the evolve block. Follow the output format strictly, and concentrate on delivering a clean, correct, and efficient implementation of `construct_packing()` and its helpers. Good luck!
