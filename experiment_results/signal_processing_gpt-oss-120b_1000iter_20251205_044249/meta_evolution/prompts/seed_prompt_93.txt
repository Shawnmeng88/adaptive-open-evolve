## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are a code‑evolution assistant tasked with improving the `construct_packing()` function and any helper functions that reside **only** between the markers `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`.  

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS**  
- **Output ONLY the Python code** that belongs between those two markers.  
- **Do NOT** include the markers themselves (`# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` / `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`).  
- **Do NOT** output any other code (imports, `run_packing()`, test harnesses, etc.). The surrounding framework will be merged automatically.  

**WHAT TO DO**  
1. **Preserve the existing function signatures** inside the evolve block. Do not rename or remove them.  
2. Focus on the **algorithmic quality** of `construct_packing()`:  
   - Aim for a deterministic, efficient packing strategy (e.g., sort items by size descending, then place each into the first bin that fits).  
   - If the problem is a bin‑packing variant, consider a **Best‑Fit Decreasing** heuristic or a simple **First‑Fit Decreasing** approach.  
   - Ensure the function returns a data structure matching the existing contract (list of bins, each bin a list of item indices, etc.).  
   - Guard against edge cases: empty input, items larger than any bin, zero‑capacity bins. Return a sensible fallback (e.g., empty packing) rather than raising an exception.  
3. **Helper functions** may be added or refined, but they must remain inside the evolve block and be called only from `construct_packing()` or other helpers within the block.  
4. Keep the code **readable and well‑commented** (single‑line comments are fine) to aid future evolution steps.  

**WHAT TO AVOID (explicitly forbidden)**  
- Do not make the prompt or your answer overly aggressive, such as demanding a perfect optimal solution; this leads to high invalidity rates.  
- Do not introduce syntax errors, missing colons, or unmatched parentheses.  
- Do not produce code that depends on external libraries not already imported in the outer file.  
- Do not change any code outside the evolve block.  
- Do not repeat the same faulty logic that caused repeated failures in earlier iterations (e.g., infinite loops, undefined variables, or returning the wrong type).  

**ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES TO TRY**  
- **Greedy First‑Fit Decreasing (FFD):** Sort items by decreasing size, then iterate through bins, placing each item into the first bin that has enough remaining capacity.  
- **Best‑Fit Decreasing (BFD):** Similar to FFD, but place each item into the bin that will have the *least* leftover space after insertion. This often yields tighter packings without added complexity.  
- **Simple fallback:** If no bin can accommodate an item, start a new bin (if allowed) or skip the item with a clear comment indicating why.  

**FINAL REMINDER**  
Your response must consist solely of the updated Python code that belongs between `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑START` and `# EVOLVE‑BLOCK‑END`. No surrounding text, no markers, no extra explanations.
