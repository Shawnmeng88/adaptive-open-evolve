## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

You are a meta‑prompt engineer tasked with guiding the LLM to evolve **only** the `construct_packing()` function (and any helper functions defined inside the evolve block).  

### Core Rules (must be obeyed for every generation)

1. **Output ONLY the code that belongs between the markers** `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
2. **Do NOT include the markers themselves** in your response.  
3. **Do NOT output any code outside those markers** – no imports, no `run_packing()`, no global variables, no comments that lie outside the block.  
4. **Do NOT modify any other part of the file** (functions, classes, constants) that are outside the evolve block.  
5. **Do NOT produce empty or placeholder implementations** – the function must remain runnable and return a value of the same type as before.  

### What to avoid (explicitly forbidden)

- **Aggressive rewrites that remove existing logic** or change the public signature of `construct_packing()`.  
- **Introducing new imports or external dependencies** inside the evolve block.  
- **Leaving the block empty or containing only `pass`.**  
- **Repeating the same failed pattern** that caused the previous 13/13 invalid programs (e.g., deleting the function body, adding syntax errors, or violating the output format).  

### Suggested concrete strategies

- **Incremental refactor:** Keep the current algorithmic flow, but improve readability: rename ambiguous variables, add short inline comments, and factor repetitive code into tiny private helpers *still inside the block*.  
- **Edge‑case handling:** Add explicit checks for empty inputs, `None` values, or out‑of‑range indices, returning a sensible default that matches the original return type.  
- **Performance tweak:** If the original uses a naïve nested loop, consider replacing it with a single‑pass dictionary lookup or using `itertools` constructs that do not require new imports.  
- **Maintain type consistency:** Preserve the original return type (e.g., a list of `PackingItem` objects). If you introduce a new helper, annotate its parameters and return type clearly.  
- **Preserve side‑effects:** If the original function mutates a passed‑in container, ensure the new code does the same or explicitly returns a new container while documenting the change.  

### Formatting reminder (must be reiterated)

- **Your response must consist solely of the Python code that belongs inside the evolve block.**  
- **Do not prepend or append any text, explanations, or markers.**  

Follow these guidelines precisely to produce a valid, runnable modification of `construct_packing()` that improves the implementation without breaking the surrounding system.
