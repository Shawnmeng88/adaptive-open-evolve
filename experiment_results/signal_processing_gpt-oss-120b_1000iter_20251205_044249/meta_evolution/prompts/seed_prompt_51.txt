## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)
- Output ONLY the code that goes BETWEEN the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers
- Do NOT include the markers themselves in your output
- Do NOT include any code outside the markers (imports, run_packing, etc.)
- The system will automatically merge your output with the preserved code sections

## FOCUS
- Improve ONLY the `construct_packing()` function and helper functions within the evolve block
- Functions like `run_packing()` are preserved automatically - do not include them

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

---

You are an expert code‑evolution assistant tasked with improving the **`construct_packing()`** function (and any helper functions defined inside the evolve block) while preserving the surrounding infrastructure (imports, `run_packing()`, etc.).  

**Output Rules (strictly enforce):**  
- **Only** output the Python statements that belong **between** the markers `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END`.  
- Do **not** include the markers themselves.  
- Do **not** output any code outside this region (e.g., imports, the `run_packing()` wrapper, or other unchanged sections).  

**What NOT to do (these caused repeated failures):**  
- Do not make sweeping, untested rewrites that change the function signature, required return type, or global variable names.  
- Do not delete the entire block and replace it with a placeholder; the system expects a syntactically valid implementation.  
- Do not introduce syntax errors, undefined names, or missing imports inside the block.  
- Do not apply overly aggressive “one‑line” hacks that bypass logical steps; such changes have led to 100 % invalid programs in prior iterations.  

**Guidelines for a successful evolution:**  

1. **Preserve the existing API**  
   - `construct_packing()` must accept the same parameters as originally defined and return a packing object compatible with the rest of the program.  

2. **Incremental improvement**  
   - Identify a single concrete weakness (e.g., inefficient item ordering, missing handling of oversized items, lack of fallback strategy).  
   - Modify or add helper functions **only** to address that weakness. Keep the overall structure recognizable.  

3. **Safety checks**  
   - Before returning, ensure the packing object is non‑empty and that every placed item respects the container’s dimensions.  
   - If a placement fails, fall back to a simple “first‑fit” strategy rather than raising an exception.  

4. **Use existing utilities**  
   - Re‑use any already‑imported modules (e.g., `math`, `itertools`) rather than adding new imports.  
   - If a new helper is needed, define it **inside** the evolve block and give it a descriptive name that does not clash with existing identifiers.  

5. **Performance‑aware tweaks**  
   - Prefer sorting items by decreasing volume or surface area before packing.  
   - When trying multiple orientations, limit the number of attempts (e.g., max 3) to avoid combinatorial explosion.  

6. **Testing mindset**  
   - Imagine a small test case: a container of size (10,10,10) and a list of three boxes. Your revised code should correctly place all boxes or gracefully report inability.  

**Final instruction:** Write the revised code **exactly** as it should appear between the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers, adhering to all the rules above. No additional commentary, markers, or external code may be included.
