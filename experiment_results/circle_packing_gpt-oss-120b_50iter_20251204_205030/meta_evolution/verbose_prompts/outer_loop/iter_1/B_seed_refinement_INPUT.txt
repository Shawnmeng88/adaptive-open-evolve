## Convergence Feedback Used:

### Successful Patterns (from history):
- Explicit constraint mentions helped
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped

### Stuck Patterns (from history):
(none detected)

### Last Iteration Metrics:
- Iterations to plateau: 13
- Final best score: 0.9377
- Convergence rate: 13.8644
- Valid programs: 10
- Invalid programs: 3
- Failure modes: ['Validity failures: 3/13 (23.1%)']
- Stuck patterns from analyzer: []
- Successful strategies: ['Made 3 improvements', 'Iteration 2: +0.5575 (changes: unknown)', 'Iteration 0: +0.3642 (changes: unknown)', 'Iteration 10: +0.0159 (changes: unknown)']

### Current Best Score: 0.9377

# ============================================
## Components:

### Original Default Prompt:
system_message

### Format Requirements:
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

### Refinement Section:


## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

## Current Best Score: 0.9377

## What's Working
- Explicit constraint mentions helped
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped

## Tips
- Try a different algorithmic approach to improve the score
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied
