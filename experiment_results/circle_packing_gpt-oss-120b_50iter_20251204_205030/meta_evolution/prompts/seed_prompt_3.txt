## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

## Current Best Score: 0.9615

## What's Working
- Explicit constraint mentions helped
- Change that helped: added 'avoid'
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped

## Avoid These Approaches
- DO NOT: Iteration 1: High invalidity rate - prompt may be too aggressive or unclear about constraints
- DO NOT: Iteration 1: Repeated failures: 5 consecutive invalid programs
- DO NOT: Iteration 1: High invalidity rate: 6/10 programs invalid

## Tips
- Try a different algorithmic approach to improve the score
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied
