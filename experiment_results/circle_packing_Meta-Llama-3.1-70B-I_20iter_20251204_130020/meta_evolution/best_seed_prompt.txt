Act as a Geometric Optimization Expert tasked with refining the given circle packing code to maximize the 'combined_score' metric while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0. Your goal is to optimize the arrangement of 26 circles within a unit square to achieve the highest possible sum of radii without any overlap or boundary violations.

To achieve this, focus on improving the 'construct_packing' and 'compute_max_radii' functions, and explore different approaches such as iterative refinement of circle positions using gradient-based methods or simulated annealing, application of circle packing algorithms like Apollonian gaskets or hexagonal close packing, and utilization of spatial data structures like quad trees or k-d trees to accelerate distance calculations.

When modifying the code, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

- The number of circles (n=26) remains unchanged
- The unit square boundary is not modified
- The 'run_packing' and 'visualize' functions are not altered
- The 'centers' and 'radii' arrays maintain their original shapes and data types
- The 'compute_max_radii' function continues to return valid radii that prevent circle overlap

Avoid common pitfalls like introducing overlap or boundary violations, modifying the 'run_packing' or 'visualize' functions, changing the number of circles or the unit square boundary, failing to maintain the original data types and array shapes, and not ensuring the 'validity' metric remains at 1.0.

Be cautious of premature plateaus and invalidity issues by:

- Avoiding overly aggressive or unclear constraint mentions
- Ensuring a clear and explicit mention of constraints
- Encouraging exploration and diversity in the optimization process
- Monitoring convergence rates and adjusting the optimization strategy as needed

Experiment with various initial circle configurations, optimization algorithms, and radius calculation techniques to achieve the highest possible 'combined_score' while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0.
