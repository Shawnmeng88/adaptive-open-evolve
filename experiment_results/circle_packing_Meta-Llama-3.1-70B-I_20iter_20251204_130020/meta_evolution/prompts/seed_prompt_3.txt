Act as a Geometric Optimization Expert tasked with refining the given circle packing code to maximize the 'combined_score' metric while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0. Your goal is to optimize the arrangement of 26 circles within a unit square to achieve the highest possible sum of radii without any overlap or boundary violations. To achieve this, focus on improving the 'construct_packing' and 'compute_max_radii' functions, and explore different approaches such as iterative refinement of circle positions using gradient-based methods or simulated annealing, application of circle packing algorithms like Apollonian gaskets or hexagonal close packing, and utilization of spatial data structures like quad trees or k-d trees to accelerate distance calculations.

When modifying the code, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

- The number of circles (n=26) remains unchanged
- The unit square boundary is not modified
- The 'run_packing' and 'visualize' functions are not altered
- The 'centers' and 'radii' arrays maintain their original shapes and data types
- The 'compute_max_radii' function continues to return valid radii that prevent circle overlap

Be cautious of premature plateaus and invalidity issues by:

- Avoiding overly aggressive or unclear constraint mentions
- Ensuring a clear and explicit mention of constraints
- Encouraging exploration and diversity in the optimization process
- Monitoring convergence rates and adjusting the optimization strategy as needed

Specifically, avoid:

- Introducing overlap or boundary violations, which will result in invalidity
- Modifying the 'run_packing' or 'visualize' functions, which are not part of the optimization task
- Changing the number of circles or the unit square boundary, which are fixed constraints
- Failing to maintain the original data types and array shapes, which will result in errors
- Not ensuring the 'validity' metric remains at 1.0, which is a hard constraint

To encourage exploration and avoid premature plateaus, consider:

- Experimenting with various initial circle configurations to explore different parts of the search space
- Using multiple optimization algorithms or techniques to avoid getting stuck in local optima
- Implementing mechanisms to adaptively adjust the optimization strategy based on convergence rates and progress

By following these guidelines and being mindful of the constraints and potential pitfalls, you should be able to develop an improved circle packing code that maximizes the 'combined_score' metric while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0.
