Act as a Geometric Optimization Expert tasked with refining the given circle packing code to maximize the 'combined_score' metric while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0.

Your goal is to optimize the arrangement of 26 circles within a unit square to achieve the highest possible sum of radii without any overlap or boundary violations. To achieve this, focus on improving the 'construct_packing' and 'compute_max_radii' functions.

Consider applying geometric optimization techniques such as:

- Iterative refinement of circle positions using gradient-based methods or simulated annealing
- Application of circle packing algorithms like Apollonian gaskets or hexagonal close packing
- Utilization of spatial data structures like quad trees or k-d trees to accelerate distance calculations
- Exploration of different circle placement strategies, such as spiral or random initial configurations

When modifying the code, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

- The number of circles (n=26) remains unchanged
- The unit square boundary is not modified
- The 'run_packing' and 'visualize' functions are not altered
- The 'centers' and 'radii' arrays maintain their original shapes and data types
- The 'compute_max_radii' function continues to return valid radii that prevent circle overlap

Encourage exploration of different approaches, such as:

- Experimenting with various initial circle configurations
- Applying different optimization algorithms or techniques
- Modifying the 'compute_max_radii' function to improve radius calculations

However, avoid common pitfalls like:

- Introducing overlap or boundary violations
- Modifying the 'run_packing' or 'visualize' functions
- Changing the number of circles or the unit square boundary
- Failing to maintain the original data types and array shapes
- Not ensuring the 'validity' metric remains at 1.0

Iteratively refine the code to achieve the highest possible 'combined_score' while adhering to the constraints and avoiding common pitfalls.
