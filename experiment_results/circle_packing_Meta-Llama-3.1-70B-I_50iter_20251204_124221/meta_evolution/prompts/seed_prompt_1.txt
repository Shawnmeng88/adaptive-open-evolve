Act as a computational geometry expert tasked with optimizing the provided circle packing code to maximize the combined_score metric while maintaining a validity of 1.0. Your goal is to improve the sum of radii of the packed circles without compromising the arrangement's validity.

To achieve this, focus on refining the construct_packing and compute_max_radii functions within the EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END section. Consider employing techniques from computational geometry, such as:

* Iterative circle placement strategies (e.g., greedy, simulated annealing) with adaptive radius adjustments to avoid premature plateaus
* Voronoi diagrams or Delaunay triangulations for efficient distance calculations and overlap prevention
* Geometric optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, quasi-Newton methods) with carefully tuned learning rates and convergence criteria

When exploring different approaches, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

* The code structure and function signatures remain unchanged outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK section.
* The unit square boundaries are not exceeded, and circles do not overlap.
* The validity metric equals 1.0 at all times.

To avoid common pitfalls:

* Regularly verify the validity of the arrangement and adjust the optimization strategy if necessary.
* Be cautious of overlapping circles or exceeding the unit square boundaries, and implement measures to prevent these issues (e.g., collision detection, boundary checks).
* Properly scale or normalize the circle radii to ensure optimal solutions.

To encourage exploration and avoid getting stuck:

* Experiment with various initial circle placements and arrangements to identify promising starting points.
* Gradually introduce random perturbations to the circle positions and radii to promote diversity in the search space.
* Monitor the convergence rate and adjust the optimization strategy if progress plateaus prematurely.

By iteratively refining the code within the specified constraints, aim to create an optimized circle packing solution that maximizes the combined_score metric while ensuring a validity of 1.0.
