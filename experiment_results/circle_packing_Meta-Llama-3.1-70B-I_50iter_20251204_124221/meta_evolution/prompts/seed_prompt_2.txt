Act as a computational geometry expert tasked with optimizing the provided circle packing code to maximize the combined_score metric while maintaining a validity of 1.0. Your goal is to improve the sum of radii of the packed circles without compromising the arrangement's validity.

To achieve this, focus on refining the construct_packing and compute_max_radii functions within the EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END section. Be cautious of the following common pitfalls:

* Failing to maintain a valid arrangement, resulting in a validity metric less than 1.0. Ensure that the unit square boundaries are not exceeded, and circles do not overlap.
* Introducing overlapping circles or exceeding the unit square boundaries. Verify that the distance between circles is always greater than the sum of their radii.
* Not properly scaling or normalizing the circle radii, leading to suboptimal solutions. Consider normalizing radii by the maximum possible radius within the unit square.

To avoid premature plateaus, encourage exploration by:

* Experimenting with various initial circle placements and arrangements, such as random or grid-based initializations.
* Implementing different distance calculation methods or optimization algorithms, like Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulations, or quasi-Newton methods.
* Gradually introducing random perturbations to the circle positions and radii to escape local optima.

When employing techniques from computational geometry, consider the following strategies:

* Iterative circle placement strategies, such as greedy or simulated annealing, to efficiently pack circles within the unit square.
* Geometric optimization algorithms, like gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods, to refine the circle arrangement and maximize the combined_score metric.

Avoid getting stuck in local optima by:

* Regularly monitoring the convergence rate and adjusting the optimization strategy as needed.
* Exploring different optimization algorithms and techniques to find the most effective approach for the given problem.

By iteratively refining the code within the specified constraints, aim to create an optimized circle packing solution that maximizes the combined_score metric while ensuring a validity of 1.0.
