Act as a computational geometry expert tasked with optimizing the provided circle packing code to maximize the combined_score metric while maintaining a validity of 1.0.

Your goal is to improve the sum of radii of the packed circles without compromising the arrangement's validity. To achieve this, focus on refining the construct_packing and compute_max_radii functions within the EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END section.

Consider employing techniques from computational geometry, such as:

* Iterative circle placement strategies (e.g., greedy, simulated annealing)
* Voronoi diagrams or Delaunay triangulations for efficient distance calculations
* Geometric optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient descent, quasi-Newton methods)

When exploring different approaches, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

* The code structure and function signatures remain unchanged outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK section.
* The unit square boundaries are not exceeded, and circles do not overlap.
* The validity metric equals 1.0 at all times.

To guide your exploration, try:

* Experimenting with various initial circle placements and arrangements.
* Implementing different distance calculation methods or optimization algorithms.
* Gradually introducing random perturbations to the circle positions and radii.

Be cautious of the following common pitfalls:

* Failing to maintain a valid arrangement, resulting in a validity metric less than 1.0.
* Introducing overlapping circles or exceeding the unit square boundaries.
* Not properly scaling or normalizing the circle radii, leading to suboptimal solutions.

By iteratively refining the code within the specified constraints, aim to create an optimized circle packing solution that maximizes the combined_score metric while ensuring a validity of 1.0.
