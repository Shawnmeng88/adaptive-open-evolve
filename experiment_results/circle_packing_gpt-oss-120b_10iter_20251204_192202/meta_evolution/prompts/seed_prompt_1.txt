## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

## Optimization Tips
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Maximize the 'combined_score' metric while keeping 'validity' = 1.0
- Try different mathematical approaches (linear programming, geometric optimization)
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied before returning

## Current Best Score: 0.7048

## What's Working
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped
- Explicit constraint mentions helped

## Tips
- Try a different algorithmic approach to improve the score
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied
