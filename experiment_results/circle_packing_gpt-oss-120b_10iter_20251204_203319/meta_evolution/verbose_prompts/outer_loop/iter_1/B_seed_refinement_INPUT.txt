# Prompt Type: B
# Outer Iteration: 1
# This is the INPUT to the MetaLLM

# PROMPT REFINEMENT - ITERATION 1
# ============================================

## Convergence Feedback Used:

### Successful Patterns (from history):
- Explicit constraint mentions helped
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped

### Stuck Patterns (from history):
- Iteration 0: High invalidity rate - prompt may be too aggressive or unclear about constraints
- Iteration 0: High invalidity rate: 4/6 programs invalid

### Last Iteration Metrics:
- Iterations to plateau: 6
- Final best score: 0.9298
- Convergence rate: 6.4531
- Valid programs: 2
- Invalid programs: 4
- Failure modes: ['Validity failures: 4/6 (66.7%)']
- Stuck patterns from analyzer: ['High invalidity rate: 4/6 programs invalid']
- Successful strategies: ['Made 2 improvements', 'Iteration 1: +0.5656 (changes: unknown)', 'Iteration 0: +0.3642 (changes: unknown)']

### Current Best Score: 0.9298

# ============================================
## Components:

### Original Default Prompt:
system_message

### Format Requirements:
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

### Refinement Section:


## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

## Current Best Score: 0.9298

## What's Working
- Explicit constraint mentions helped
- Negative guidance (what to avoid) helped

## Avoid These Approaches
- DO NOT: Iteration 0: High invalidity rate - prompt may be too aggressive or unclear about constraints
- DO NOT: Iteration 0: High invalidity rate: 4/6 programs invalid

## Tips
- Try a different algorithmic approach to improve the score
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied
