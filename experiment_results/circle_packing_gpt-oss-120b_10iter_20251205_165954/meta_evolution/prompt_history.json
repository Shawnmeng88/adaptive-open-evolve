Automate a small grid search over these parameters and keep the best\u2011performing configuration.  \n- **Iterative improvement loop**: After establishing a baseline layout, repeatedly:\n  1. Compute the maximal radius for each circle given the current positions.  \n  2. Identify circles whose radii are limited by a neighbor rather than the border.  \n  3. Slightly move those circles away from each other (or toward the border) to free up radius, then recompute.  \n- **Hybrid approach**: Combine a deterministic geometric pattern with a lightweight optimizer (e.g., SciPy\u2019s `minimize` with constraints) to fine\u2011tune positions.  \n\n**Pitfalls to Avoid**  \n- **Violating constraints**: Never return a layout where any circle exceeds the distance to a wall or overlaps another circle. Even a tiny violation will set validity to zero.  \n- **Hard\u2011coding values**: Avoid fixed radii or positions that assume a particular layout; the optimizer should adapt if the pattern changes.  \n- **Infinite loops or excessive computation**: Keep iterative refinements bounded (e.g., limit to a few dozen passes or a small time budget) to ensure the solution runs quickly.  \n- **Numerical instability**: When scaling radii to resolve overlaps, ensure the scaling factor is computed safely and does not produce negative or NaN radii.  \n- **Over\u2011complexity**: Introducing heavyweight external solvers or unnecessary data structures can slow down evaluation and may be rejected by the testing harness.
