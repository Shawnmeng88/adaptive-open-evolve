## CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- ONLY modify code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- DO NOT modify or remove code outside the EVOLVE-BLOCK
- The function `run_packing()` MUST exist and be callable
- DO NOT rename or remove the `run_packing()` function
- The function `construct_packing()` MUST be defined (called by run_packing)

Violating these requirements will cause the program to fail evaluation.

## Current Best Score: 0.8763

## Last Iteration Performance
- Valid programs: 6/10 (60% success rate)
- Best score achieved: 0.8763
- Iterations to improvement: 10

## What Worked (from actual code evolution)
- Made 4 improvements
- Iteration 2: +0.6376 (changes: unknown)
- Iteration 8: +0.1505 (changes: unknown)

## CRITICAL: Actual Failure Modes (fix these!)
- Validity failures: 4/10 (40.0%)

## Tips
- Try a different algorithmic approach to improve the score
- Focus on the algorithm inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK markers
- Ensure all constraints are satisfied
