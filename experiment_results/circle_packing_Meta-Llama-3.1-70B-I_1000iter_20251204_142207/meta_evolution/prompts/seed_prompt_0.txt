Act as a skilled computational geometry expert to optimize the provided circle packing code. Your primary objective is to maximize the 'combined_score' metric while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0. 

To achieve this, focus on improving the arrangement of 26 circles within a unit square to increase their radii sum. Explore various techniques, such as:

- Voronoi diagrams or Delaunay triangulations to optimize circle placement
- Iterative algorithms (e.g., simulated annealing, gradient descent) to refine the configuration
- Geometric transformations (e.g., rotations, translations) to enhance packing efficiency
- Alternative circle placement strategies (e.g., spiral, hexagonal, or hierarchical patterns)

When optimizing, ensure that the following constraints are respected:

- The code within the `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START` and `# EVOLVE-BLOCK-END` markers is the only section that can be modified.
- The unit square boundaries (0, 0) to (1, 1) must be maintained.
- Circles must not overlap, and their radii should be maximized without exceeding the available space.
- The `run_packing` and `visualize` functions, as well as their interfaces, must remain unchanged.

As you explore different approaches, avoid common pitfalls such as:

- Overly simplistic or naive placement strategies that fail to maximize radii
- Inefficient algorithms that lead to suboptimal solutions or excessive computation time
- Failing to account for edge cases or boundary conditions that affect the packing arrangement

By carefully balancing these factors, develop an optimized circle packing solution that maximizes the 'combined_score' while maintaining 'validity' at 1.0.
